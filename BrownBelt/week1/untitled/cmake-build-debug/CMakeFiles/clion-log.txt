CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:4 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindTd.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked
  CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Td", but CMake did
  not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Td" (requested
  version 1.7.8) with any of the following names:

    TdConfig.cmake
    td-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Td" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "Td_DIR" to
  a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Td" provides a separate
  development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
